# **Ecommerce Follow-Along**

### **Welcome!**

The **Ecommerce Follow-Along** is an exciting, hands-on project where you’ll learn to build a complete e-commerce platform using the MERN stack. With guidance from a mentor, you’ll dive into creating APIs, setting up user authentication, designing databases, and crafting a reliable backend with Node.js and Express.

## **Why Use the MERN Stack?**

The MERN stack is one of the most popular tools for building web applications—and for good reason!  
- It’s **JavaScript all the way**: one language for both the frontend and backend, making it perfect for beginners.  
- It’s **powerful and efficient**: everything you need to build a fast, scalable app.  

Here’s a quick breakdown of what makes up the MERN stack:  
- **MongoDB**: A flexible database for storing your app’s data.  
- **Express**: A framework that makes backend development a breeze.  
- **React**: A library for creating beautiful, interactive user interfaces.  
- **Node.js**: A runtime that lets you run JavaScript on the server.

## **What Will You Build?**

This project is all about creating a fully functional e-commerce platform. Here’s what you’ll be working on:

### **1. RESTful APIs**
APIs are the bridge between the frontend and backend. You’ll build APIs to:  
- Let users sign up, log in, and stay secure.  
- Manage products—add, update, and retrieve details.  
- Handle customer orders smoothly and efficiently.  

All data will be managed using MongoDB and formatted as JSON for easy use and testing.

### **2. Database Design**
You’ll design the structure of the app’s database, organizing it into collections like:  
- **Users**: To keep track of customer details.  
- **Products**: To manage inventory and product info.  
- **Orders**: To connect customers with their purchases.

### **3. Secure Authentication**
You’ll learn how to keep the platform safe by:  
- Verifying user identities.  
- Protecting sensitive data like passwords and orders.

## **What Will You Learn?**

By the end of this project, you’ll be able to:  
- Build APIs that work seamlessly in real-world apps.  
- Set up a solid backend with Node.js and Express.  
- Design organized and efficient databases using MongoDB.  
- Add secure login and authentication features.  
- Use React to create a sleek, user-friendly interface.
